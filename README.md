Simplify serialize.h's exception handling

Remove the 'state' and 'exceptmask' from serialize.h's stream
implementations, as well as related methods.

As exceptmask always included 'failbit', and setstate was always
called with bits = failbit, all it did was immediately raise an
exception. Get rid of those variables, and replace the setstate
with direct exception throwing (which also removes some dead
code).

As a result, good() is never reached after a failure (there are
only 2 calls, one of which is in tests), and can just be replaced
by !eof().

fail(), clear(n) and exceptions() are just never called. Delete
them.
```
